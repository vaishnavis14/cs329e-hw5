This project involves analyzing the spatial distribution of stars from the Bright Star Catalog by converting astronomical coordinates (right ascension, declination, and parallax) into 3D Cartesian coordinates. Using libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Astropy, stars are categorized based on their spectral types (e.g., O, B, A) and visualized in a 3D scatter plot with color-coded markers representing different star types. This visualization provides insights into star classifications and their spatial arrangement in the galaxy.
